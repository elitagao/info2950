    "All across social media platforms, there are running advertisements for different beauty products. According to [GlobalNewswire](https://loudcloudhealth.com/resources/beauty-industry-statistics/#:~:text=How%20much%20is%20the%20cosmetic,value%20is%20over%20%2493%20billion), the global skincare market is worth \\$145.3 billion. Skincare is a very important market segment to examine as it accounts for 40\\% of the global cosmetic market. On YouTube, there are many skincare specialists such as Hyram (Instagram: [@skincarebyhyram](https://www.instagram.com/skincarebyhyram/)), Sarah Cheung (Instagram: [@sacheu](https://www.instagram.com/sacheu/)), and Renee (Instagram: [@gothamista](https://www.instagram.com/gothamista/)) among many others who have amassed a huge following. These influencers produce video about skincare product recommendations, skincare routines within specific budgets, for specific skin concerns, must-haves and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, as a skin-enthusiast and a connoisseur of these videos and target group for sponsored social media advertisements, products are always flooding my feed to indulge in new skin care products. This piqued our group's interest to dive deeper into the skincare area in search of better understanding how exactly products differentiate themselves from others in terms of better results, lowest cost, and best rating.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By working with 2 skin care data sets from Sephora and Ulta, our group hopes to identify whether there exists a correlation between ingredients in skincare products and the prices or ratings of the products. In particular, are product prices influenced more so by the name value of brands or the quality of ingredients? Are expensive products worth the cost? Additionally, we are examining whether high-end brands get better ratings and whether products containing parabens have significant differential ratings and prices from those that do not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By answering these questions, we hope to shed light on how to shop for skincare products, and whether highly rated products are worth the hype by examining the quality  of ingredients.\n",
    " \n",
    "Below is a brief summary of our findings:<br>\n",
    "We determined there is no statistically significant difference in rating between those of high-end products and drugstore/mid-priced items. Price is also not a statistically significant predictor of product rating. Additionally, while a product that contains parabens is on average $25.93 more expensive than a product that does not contain parabens, the inclusion of parabens in a product is not a statistically significant indicator of the product’s ranking. \n",

    "### Dataset 1:\n",
    "- Dataset 1 was created by Jiwon Jeong (GitHub user jjone36) for a Cosmetic Recommendation System on November 28, 2018. Here is the article that describes her scraping and analysis process: https://towardsdatascience.com/for-your-skin-beauty-mapping-cosmetic-items-with-bokeh-af7523ca68e5.\n",
    "- Observations: skincare product items. Attributes include its price, brand, rank, ingredients, and for what skin type for whom the product would be most useful. Each row corresponds to one product.\n",
    "- Since it is difficult to choose what cosmetic items fit for different skin types, the creator decided to build a simple cosmetic recommendation system.\n",
    "- It is unclear who funded the creation of the dataset. Since the dataset does not involve experimental data but rather observational data, it is possible that no funding was required.\n",
    "- The skincare products may not be representative of all brands because the creator only used data from Sephora and not only cosmetic stores. Because of this, prices may also not be the original prices from the brands themselves but marked by Sephora. In addition, it is possible that these products have changed from 2018 to now.\n",
    "- The dataset that we are using is the original dataset that the creator had not preprocessed. We wanted to start from scratch for more data-cleaning practice and learning. In addition, our research question differs from the creator’s. Rather than re-building the cosmetic recommendation system that she had built, we instead are examining any correlations between the rank and price of cosmetic items between different brands and for different skin types.\n",
    "- The people involved in data collection contributed to the 'rank' column for their average reviews.\n",
    "- Our raw source data can be found in our Colab Notebooks Google Drive, titled [cosmetic.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1br0b-r_qFnh-bNIY8xPsmC8a4Pw-ulZX?usp=sharing). Alternatively, it can also be found on the creator’s GitHub.\n"

    "### Dataset 2:\n",
    "What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?\n",
    "- The observations are the face moisturizer products listed on the Ulta website. The attributes are the product's brand, name, price(\\$), rating, and a list of ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why was this dataset created?\n",
    "- This data set was created to accompany the Sephora dataset we have. The dataset includes more products to see if there are relationships present between product ingredients, ratings, and price that were overrepresented or underrepresented by only looking at the Sephora website data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who funded the creation of the dataset?\n",
    "- No one funded the creation of this dataset. Our group used Python’s Selenium package to web scrape public data from Ulta's website to build this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?\n",
    "- Due to the complicated nature of web scraping Ulta's website, it was not feasible to get all skin care products in a timely manner. Therefore, we decided to focus on just the face moisturizer category of products. Because of the limitations, we specifically chose facial moisturizer out of all skincare products because it is one of the most essential steps in skin care and is a product that stays on the skin for an extended period without being washed off unlike cleansers. \n",
    "- We used Selenium WebDriver to webscrape. In this process we had to extract specific xpaths to get all of the attributes of a product. We then looped over every face moisturizer to get all the information for each product. Some product's attributes were not at the same xpath as the first product we used, so some data was not recorded. To remedy this, we manually filled in the missing data that was not successfully web scraped.\n",
    "\n",
    "What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?\n",
    "- As briefly mentioned above, we used Selenium WebDriver to webscrape Ulta's face moisturizer website page. We looped through each face moisturizer product to extract its attributes and stored it in a CSV file. We had 7 CSV files (one for each page of products) that we combined into one larger CSV file. The CSV file was then downloaded and opened in Excel where we manually filled in the missing data that was not successfully web scraped. Additionally, we removed all products that were mini, travel size, or kits. This is because mini and travel size products were duplicates of their full size counterparts and would also skew and distract any analysis regarding price. We also removed any products that were kits or sets of several products bundled together because it would affect the rating. We are not able to pin down which product within the set was good or bad. To add on, we decided to remove kits and sets since the focus of our analysis was to get individual products and not the combination of products. Finally, we imported the CSV file into our notebook and saved it as a dataframe to use for our analyses. \n",
    " \n",
    "If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?\n",
    "- No people were involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data (hosted in a Cornell Google Drive or Cornell Box).\n",

    "#### Introduction:\n",
    "When looking at our skin care datasets from Sephora and [Ulta](https://www.ulta.com/skin-care?N=2707), we are primarily interested in the relationship between rating and price of products from different brands and created from different ingredients. Along with our main questions, we are also examining whether high-end brands get better ratings, what ingredients are most popular in acne products, and whether products containing parabens have significant differential ratings and prices from those that do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preregistration of two analyses :\n",
    "1. To determine **whether high-end products have differential ratings from drugstore and mid-price items**, we will perform a T-test of the mean ratings between these price points. We will also perform linear regression and possibly k-means clustering, if applicable. For the linear regression, ratings will be the dependent variable and price will be the independent variable.\n",
    "- <ins>**What we expect to see:**</ins> We do not expect to see a clear positive correlation between price and rating, since drugstore and mid-price items often have as good or even better performance on the skin. In addition, the demographics of the consumers may also vary based on social-economic status, attributing to their different needs in skincare.\n",
    "2. Next, **we will examine parabens**. In the ‘ingredients’ column of the datasets, we will index to find all the products that contain parabens such as methylparabens and ethylparabens. We will then perform two linear regressions: one with price as the outcome and a second with rating as the outcome. The predictor variables for these regressions will be a dummy variable indicating if the product contains parabens, price/rating (whichever is not the dependent variable), and skin type dummy variables. \n",
    "- <ins>**What we expect to see:**</ins> Parabens are not favorable in skin products. Many products will advertise that they are paraben-free. Though parabens increase shelf life, they have been [found to increase breast cancer cell tissue](https://www.byrdie.com/what-are-parabens). However, those who are purchasing products with parabens may not be aware of that fact, living in a state of “blissful ignorance,” so we also do not instinctively expect any significant correlations between products with and without parabens. On the inverse, those who are aware of the potentially harmful impacts of parabens may be proud of their choice to purchase paraben-free products, thus rating non-paraben products more highly.\n"

    "The results from our analysis of the `skin` dataset are very interesting and can explain a lot about the market for skincare. To be clear, ranking and rating are analogous and will be used interchangeably in our interpretations. In our first pre-registered analysis, we wanted to see whether high-end products have significantly different ratings than drugstore/mid-priced items. After performing a t-test of mean rankings, we found a p-value of .986, which is greater than our .05 significance level, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in rankings. This result matches our initial predictions, and we are confident in this result. We did not expect to see a clear distinction between price and rating, since drugstore and mid-price items often have as good or even better performance on the skin. Moreover, the demographics of the consumers may also vary based on social-economic status, attributing to their different needs in skincare. Normally, “high-end” skin care products are marketed for the name-brand reputation, but do not produce significantly better results than lower priced products. To follow-up our t-test, we carried out a linear regression where we regressed rank on price. The coefficient value -0.0004 tells us that on average for every \\$1 increase in a product's price, the rank of that product decreases by 0.0004 units, ceteris paribus. This coefficient has a p-value of 0.288, which means it is not statistically significant at the .05 level. One reason why this model was not statistically significant is because this prediction of rank was solely based on price; however, there are many other factors that could affect a product’s ranking, such as skin type, other people’s and reviewers’ opinions, duration of use, and ingredients, to name a few. Later on in our analysis we take a look at a few of these other possible factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our second pre-registered analysis looked at products containing parabens, a harmful ingredient found in many cosmetic products, and their effect on a product’s price and rankings. We looked at two linear regression models to determine parabens’ effects. Our first linear regression regressed price on whether a product contains parabens. We added additional controls of ranking and skin-type dummy variables to reduce the effect of omitted variable bias. The coefficient on containing parabens was 25.93 with a p-value of 0. This means that on average, a product that contains parabens has a price $25.93 greater than a product that does not contain parabens in its ingredient list, ceteris paribus. This result is statistically significant indicated by the p-value. Our 2nd linear regression looked at ranking as the outcome variable, with parabens as the main independent variable and adding additional controls of price and skin-type dummy variables. The coefficient on containing parabens was -0.0795 with a p-value of 0.235. This means that on average, a product that contains parabens has a ranking of 0.0795 units lower than a product that does not contain parabens. However, this result is not statistically significant.It is interesting that the existence of  parabens has a significant effect on a product's price but not on its ranking. This could be because rankings are a more subjective measurement as they are simply people’s own opinions on a product. Also, parabens may not show an effect on ratings by reviewers since its negative effects, such as increase risk of breast cancer, is a long-term effect through years of use and is not something that can be noticed immediately unlike breakout, redness, or allergic reactions. Whereas, pricing a product is a methodical procedure by a company. It could be that if a company uses parabens in their products, they advertise their product as longer lasting (a benefit to using parabens), and perhaps people will be willing to spend more money on what they think is ‘better’ products. Also, it’s possible that people who use products with parabens in it do not recognize that their products contain parabens so they are willing to pay whatever the market price is for that product. Companies may even charge more for paraben-containing products to cover the risk of selling products with harmful ingredients. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from our pre-registered analyses, we carried out more analyses to examine how parabens, price, rating, skin-type, and product labelling can affect a product’s success. We executed a linear regression model to determine the relationship between price of a product and whether it contains parabens. From our findings, it appears to be the case that price is not strongly correlated with other variables. This may be due to the nature of the cosmetic and skincare industry. As cosmetics have grown in popularity, many users, especially women, prefer to use  products which are handy and easy to use while travelling. Many women may also be willing to pay more money for products that are hypoallergenic. In addition, the use of natural ingredients that don’t harm the skin is a popular strategy of manufacturers. This could be one reason why rank is not strongly correlated with price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we executed 2 train-test splits (test sizes of 20%) to evaluate the performance of our training set on predicting whether a product contains parabens based on the price of the products and based on rank. Both models, predict parabens based on price and based on rank, had very high prediction accuracies of 93.5% and 94.7%, respectively. We are not confident in these results for a few reasons. Although this is a very high accuracy, we must keep in mind that a small proportion of our products actually contain parabens. This might mean that there is not a sufficient number of datapoints with parabens, and therefore there is not actually enough data in the test set to properly evaluate the model performance. In terms of the bigger picture, both our train and test datasets are most likely not suitable representations of the problem domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in our analysis, we performed a linear regression model, specifically a linear probability model using the binary variable `contains_parabens` as the dependent variable. We showed that a linear model is not the most suitable model to examine this outcome variable. Therefore, we conducted 2 logistic regressions to predict the likelihood of a product containing parabens given its price and given its rank. We found that as price increases, the probability that the product will contain parabens also increases. Conversely, as the rank increases, the probability that the product will contain parabens decreases. Our analysis and supporting scatter plot show that while there are these trends, the likelihood that a product contains parabens based on these factors is relatively low (mostly ranging from 4-10% chance). These results are justifiable because it could be that most products that contain parabens have higher prices on average (as we determined above), so this same relationship could hold looking at it the other way around. Another explanation as to why paraben likelihood and rank are inversely related is that people who are conscious of the ingredients in their products may be more cognizant on how products work and are more biased towards products that don’t contain parabens, so they rank those products higher. The overall estimated probabilities of a product containing parabens is very reasonable because many companies and consumers are becoming more aware of the harmful effects of parabens relating to health. Even in our dataset, there is only a small subset of products that contain parabens, so it is believable that this small likelihood result is very close to the true proportion of products on the market that contain parabens. \n",
    "\n",
    "To further understand how parabens relate to a product’s price and rank, we conducted t-tests to see if there was a significant difference in mean price and mean rank between products that with and without parabens.  The p value for the difference in mean t-test is 0.0002557. Since our P value is less than our significant level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. In other words, there is a statistically significant difference between the mean price of products with and without parabens. In order to get an even better sense of whether there is truly a significant difference in the rank and price of products with and without parabens, we decided to do a bootstrap resampling and recalculate the p-value using our new sample. We resampled our data with replacement 10000 times to get a sense of what our data might have looked like if we looked at a wider range of similar products. The bootstrap resampling gave similar results with a low p-value of 3.169e-09. We are confident in this conclusion because despite having a small subset of paraben-containing products to begin with, we still got similar results after resampling. There must be something about parabens that causes prices of products to be higher. As mentioned above, perhaps there is a small amount of risk that needs to be covered or maybe parabens are more costly to include in products because they have to pass quality assurance checks. We would be interested in looking further at this relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to go one step further to better understand which types of products this difference in price is most significant. We therefore decided to subset our data and perform the hypothesis test on each label category, to see whether there is a significant difference in price for products with and without parabens. The product labels that yielded statistically significant results were moisturizers and face-products. The face-products are made up of face masks for your skin. The other products labels tested were facial, sunscreen, cleanser, and eye. A possible explanation for this difference is that moisturizers and face masks are expected to have a long preservation life. People keep the same moisturizers for months on end. Additionally, face masks are only meant to be worn once a week, so it could take someone a while to get through their pack of face masks. Therefore, whether these products have parabens in them or not may have a large impact on their price relative to the other product categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we did many multiple regression models to see if there were any underlying or hidden relationships between our variables of interest relating to skin care products. We found that on average, skin products for normal skin have a 0.258 unit higher ranking than products that are no for normal skin. With a p-value of .009, this is a statistically significant finding. This result makes sense because people with ‘normal’ skin will likely have the least amount of problems/bad experiences with their skin products compared to people with different skin types. It’s important to note that this is a pretty large difference in ranking and it’s based solely on how a company markets their products. If companies recognize that marketing their products for ‘normal’ skin will result in a higher review ranking, then that might stifle innovation within the skincare industry. Companies may just want to grow their reputation and increase their ratings, so they will care less about creating products that work with more problematic skin-types. Alternatively, companies could just market all of their products for ‘normal’ skin even if not all products are. This could bring about problems of lying and deception by companies.     \n"

    "## Limitations \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sephora Data Set (Data set 1)\n",
    "- Since data was web scraped by someone else, the creators of the data set could have excluded some data instances or columns. This could lead to an inaccurate analysis. To accommodate for this, we plan to use multiple data sets to ensure a broader scope\n",
    "- Some of the instances have 2 values in the ‘price’ column. This makes it difficult for us to determine which value is the true price. To account for this, we manually looked through the Sephora website and decided to remove the second value in the columns where there are 2 values, as it appears that the first value is the accurate price.\n",
    "- Not representative of all cosmetic products, only the products sold at Sephora. For instance, Sephora does not carry drugstore products but only the more high-end products. To work around this limitation, we have decided to include a new dataset: products sold on Ulta Beauty's website, which sells a wider variety of products including drug store products. We will combine these 2 datasets to get a more accurate range of skincare products.\n",
    "- The `Rank` column may be skewed because it is an aggregate of reviews. So while a product may receive mostly 5s, a few 1s may cause the mean rank to go down to a 4. We do not know the distributions of the reviews for each product as a result.  \n",
    "- From 2018, so prices and product variety may have changed or have been discontinued since then. To work around this, we have data scraped from the Ulta Beauty website which includes entries from 2021. By combining these datasets, we now have products from more recent years as well as previous years.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General\n",
    "- We notice in both data sets the subsets of products that contains parabens is a very small fraction of total products (90/1600 for Sephora). Therefore, any analysis focusing on that subset may be skewed. For example, the prediction accuracies in the Train-test split models were really high, which may have been caused by the small sample of parabens. This is representative of the entire skincare market as we have seen trends away from paraben use in products, where this exclusion is even marketed on the products themselves. \n",
    "- We might not be able to make generalizations and/or recommendations, since both data sets contain a small sample of all skincare products sold. Therefore, in data analysis write up, we plan to explain that generalizations cannot be made for ALL skincare products, since this is just a small sample of all skincare products available. \n",
    "- Not every customer writes reviews, so the reviews may be generally biased toward consumers who either really liked or disliked the product. This may make our datasets slightly biased. \n",
    "- While websites like Sephora and Ulta try to maintain accuracy with product ingredients, there exists disclaimers on Ulta’s ingredient section that discuss how ingredients may always be changing since formulations are updates to the product may be constantly made. To have the most accurate ingredient list, one must refer to the ingredient list on the product bottle, but it is not feasible for us to buy all the products. The ingredient list we have, therefore, may sometimes not be the most updated, but is the best that Ulta can provide.  \n",
    "- For the data values we used in our project collectively, a limitation is the variation in product size. While we removed travel size and mini size products from the Ulta dataset to try to keep the data in reference to full size products, every brand has a different idea of full size products. There exists variations in the size of the product and therefore price does not tell the full story of price per volume/fluid ounce of product. \n"
